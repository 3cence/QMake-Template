# QMake-Template

THIS IS NOT BUILT FOR WINDOWS USERS, BECAUSE LINUX IS SUPERIOR. Now that that is out of the way...
^just use microsoft visual studio (NOT the same as VSCode). i think they have a community edition?

This is just a repo so i can get settings for VSCode QMake build stuff. If you plan on using Qt with this use Qt 5, but it works for anything.

This is really just made for me, so you will need to change the path to the build.sh script in tasks.json accordingly. I recomend just putting the build.sh file in your /home/USERNAME/ directory.

there might be more you need to change, and i really dont care.
